rules follow the standard Checkers rules, with the main difference being the smaller board size. The game board is modeled as a 6×6 array where only the black squares are playable. Each player starts the game with 6 pieces placed on the first two rows on their own side of the board. Normal pieces can move diagonally forward and are promoted to King when they reach the last row of the opponent’s side. Kings are able to move and capture diagonally in all directions.

All capture rules are fully implemented in this project. If a capture is available, making a simple move is not allowed and the player must perform a capture. Multi-jump captures are supported, and if after a capture another capture is possible, the player is required to continue capturing in the same turn. Captured pieces are removed from the board immediately and the selected move path is correctly applied to the game state. The game ends when a player has no remaining pieces or no legal moves available.

The intelligent agent is implemented using the Minimax algorithm and acts as the Maximizer, while the opponent plays the role of the Minimizer. The search depth is configurable and is set to a minimum of 3. Alpha-Beta Pruning is applied to reduce the search space, and the number of expanded nodes can be compared between the standard Minimax and the optimized version. All decisions made by the agent are based solely on the output of the Minimax algorithm.

Heuristic evaluation functions are designed to assign a numerical value to each game state from the agent’s perspective. These functions consider factors such as the number of pieces, the number of Kings, piece positioning on the board, and piece mobility. The project supports both Human vs Agent and Agent vs Agent modes. The game runs in the terminal, and piece movements are fully functional and correctly reflected on the board.

This project is implemented in Python and focuses on accurate rule enforcement, intelligent decision-making using Minimax, and analyzing the impact of Alpha-Beta Pruning and evaluation functions on gameplay.
